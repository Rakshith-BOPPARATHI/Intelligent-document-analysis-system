# Intelligent-document-analysis-system
Intelligent Document Analysis System is an ML-powered solution with the ability to categorize and analyze the sentiment of business documents automatically. It mimics an actual ML project optimized for OpenText, a world leader in Enterprise Information Management (EIM). It facilitates document classification into pre-configured categoriesâ€”like Legal, Financial, Technical, Marketing, and HRâ€”and sentiment analysis of the document content.
ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To build a production-ready document analysis tool that:
Automatically classifies documents based on their textual content.
Performs sentiment analysis (positive, neutral, negative).
Provides visual insights and comparative performance metrics.
Demonstrates scalability and integration-readiness for enterprise environments like OpenText's ECM suit
ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
This system demonstrates cutting-edge document intelligence capabilities using Python and scikit-learn, offering a scalable and intelligent foundation for OpenTextâ€™s document classification, analytics, and sentiment interpretation requirements. It showcases how machine learning can enhance enterprise information management through automation and smart analytics.
